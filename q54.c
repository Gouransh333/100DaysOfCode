Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to remove a cycle if present. A cycle exists when a node's next pointer points back to a previous node, forming a loop. Internally, a variable pos denotes the index of the node where the cycle starts, but it is not passed as a parameter. The terminal will print true if a cycle is removed otherwise, it will print false.

Examples:

Input: head = 1 -> 3 -> 4, pos = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The linked list looks like

A loop is present in the list, and it is removed.

/*
class Node {
  public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    void removeLoop(Node* head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL)
            return;

        Node* slow = head;
        Node* fast = head;

        // Step 1: Detect loop
        while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;

            if (slow == fast)
                break;
        }

        // No loop found
        if (slow != fast)
            return;

        // Step 2: Find start of loop
        slow = head;

        // Special case: loop starts at head
        if (slow == fast) {
            while (fast->next != slow)
                fast = fast->next;
        } else {
            while (slow->next != fast->next) {
                slow = slow->next;
                fast = fast->next;
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Break the loop
        fast->next = NULL;
    }
